#CariCOOS - Sea Grant Nearshore-Breaker-Model

This preliminary experimental product provides estimates of breaker heights (face value, crest to through) for many of the most popular beaches in Puerto Rico. The estimated breaker heights are based beach-specific predictions from the CariCOOS Nearshore Wave Model (http://caricoos.org/drupal/swan_multigrid) and adjustments to these predictions based on analytical and empirical formulae. Three levels of estimated breaker conditions are presented in the map below: low to moderate (maximum breaker heights < 4 feet), moderate to high (maximum breaker heights between 4 and 6 feet), and high to very large (maximum breaker heights > 6 feet). The estimates of maximum breaker heights are conservative and can overestimate the actual breaker heights, however, larger breaking waves than those predicted could occur.

This product is still in an experimental stage and should not be used to make decisions at this moment. In addition, the colored flags are only suggestive of breaker height conditions and do not constitute an official beach hazards warning level for these beaches.
